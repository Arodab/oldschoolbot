# Fishing

You can train Fishing using `/fishname:<fish>quantity:<quantity>`, for example `/fishname:Lobsterquantity:100`

Fishing bait is buyable with `/buyname: ``Fishing bait`.

Dark fishing bait and Raw Karambwanji aren't sold by the bot and can only be obtained by buying from other players or obtaining them yourself.

## Boosts

#### Angler Outfit

It's possible to get the Angler's outfit from [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler.md) as well as [Aerial fishing](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/fishing/aerial-fishing). When equipped in the skilling setup, it provides the following boosts to fishing XP:

- 0.4% - Angler hat
- 0.8% - Angler top
- 0.6% - Angler waders
- 0.2% - Angler boots
- 2.5% - Full outfit equipped in skilling setup

#### Spirit Flakes

- There is a 50% chance to catch double fish when using Spirit flakes, effectively doubling the amount of fish you can catch per trip. The extra fish does not give extra xp.

## **Tools**

Certain tools, when equipped in any setup, will speed up the time it takes to catch a fish. The following boosts are available:

- 5% for Pearl fishing rod when fishing with bait
- 5% for Pearl fly fishing rod when fly fishing
- 5% for Pearl barbarian rod when barbarian fishing
- 5% for Crystal harpoon when harpooning, caging, and netting fish

## Fishing Trawler

There is a 1/8 (12.5%) chance that you will receive a piece of the angler's outfit you do not already own, each trip. Each trip has a 1/5000 chance of rewarding the Heron pet.
