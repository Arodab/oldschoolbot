## Tips

1. Connect your OSRS username to your discord account with the `+setrsn` command, for example if your username is Woox, you'd do `+setrsn Woox`. After doing this, you will no longer need to type your username for most commands, for example, you can just type `+stats`, or `+s` for short, and it will show your stats.
